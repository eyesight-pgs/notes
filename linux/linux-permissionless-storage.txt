 
Linux permission become pretty hectic when files accessed by different users (on same os or different os).

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/422656/how-to-make-an-ext4-formatted-usb-drive-with-full-rw-permissions-for-any-linux-m
tune2fs is the solution.
We need to set a default ACL on the root directory of the USB stick filesystem that assigns full access to everyone on any new file or directory. And to ensure that the stick will be mounted with ACL support enabled, we need to use tune2fs to adjust the default mount options stored in the filesystem metadata.

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1
sudo tune2fs -o acl /dev/sdX1
sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt
sudo chown <username>: /mnt
chmod 777 /mnt
setfacl -m d:u::rwx,d:g::rwx,d:o::rwx /mnt
sudo umount /mnt
```
