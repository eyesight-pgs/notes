## configuration

[link](https://dwm.suckless.org/customisation) 

The `config.h` is used during dwm executable creation. If `config.h` file is 
missing then `config.h` is automatically created by copying contents of 
`config.def.h`. `config.def.h` file is a template file. `config.h` file 
will not be overwritten by git pull.
